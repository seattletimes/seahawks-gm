        On Sept. 5, the Seahawks will announce their final roster of 53 players. Who would you pick? Use our interactive below to choose your team &mdash; but be careful of the salary cap! This season, thanks to rollover money from previous years, the Seahawks have a maximum salary of $148.26 million, more than the NFL average of $143.28 million. But you're already committed to $55.86 million due to signing bonuses, payroll for the practice squad, and what is known as dead money: outstanding commitments to old contracts such as Percy Harvin's.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get you started, we've gone ahead and selected positions where only one player is available. One catch: Players who are currently injured are grayed-out and cannot be removed from the team. But they don't count toward your 53-player maximum. And Kam Chancellor ... even though he's currently holding out, you can select him anyway.
      </p>
